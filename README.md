# CIS 695 final project 

### Abstract
India is a developing country with a massive population; this massive population puts much strain on local municipal bodies' infrastructure and work. 
The slow and bureaucratic structure coupled with outdated reporting systems, logging, and resolving problems makes it difficult to address all the municipal 
issues plaguing any geographical area in India; this is especially bad in major cities that hold a very densely populated chunk of India's massive population. 
Most of the areas are severely affected by simple garbage not being collected, potholes on roads, open maintenance hole covers, and mosquitoes' breeding, 
with many other such issues. With the lack of digital systems to report and assess such issues, these issues go unattended for a long period resulting in major 
health and life hazards.

Through this project, an attempt is being made to develop a system that can shed light on such issues by displaying them more graphically. 
The system would be a big help and a step forward for any government agency in India working on such issues. The data to drive such a system 
comes from the citizen reporter section of a major newspaper outlet in India, where citizens can log and report any problem affecting their locality.
